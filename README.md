## THE EN-LESS-ENATOR

If you tell Facebook not to show you "suggested for you" posts then you see progressively less well suggested for you posts.

But if you don't then you see a bunch of clickbait that you don't want to see.

Maybe I should stop using Facebook but for now... can I make a chrome extension that will hide things I don't want to see.
